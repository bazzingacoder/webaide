[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/your_netlify_badge_id/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/webaide/deploys)

Welcome to **Webaide**, a comprehensive, single-page resource hub dedicated to web accessibility. This project, whose name stands for **Accessibility Info & Development Ecosystem**, is designed to be a central place for developers and designers to find tools, guides, and standards for building more inclusive web experiences.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Comprehensive Resource Hub:** A curated list of over 100 accessibility resources, loaded dynamically from a central `resources.json` file.
* **Live Search & Filtering:** A powerful and accessible search bar with live suggestions and multi-select category filters to easily find the exact resource you need.
* **Permalinks:** The app's state is saved in the URL, allowing you to bookmark and share links to specific search queries or filtered views.
* **User Submissions:** A community-driven approach where users can suggest new resources through an accessible feedback form.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** A user-friendly theme toggle that respects and remembers the user's OS-level or manually selected preference.
* **Fully Accessible:** Built with accessibility as a first principle, including skip links, full keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and a focus-trapped modal.
* **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive interface with skeleton loaders for a smooth loading experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This is a static website built with vanilla HTML, CSS (via Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. It does not require a complex build process.

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser.
* A local web server to handle `fetch` requests for the `resources.json` file. The easiest way to do this is with the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/bazzingacoder/webaide.git](https://github.com/bazzingacoder/webaide.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd webaide
    ```
3.  **Open with Live Server:**
    * If you are using VS Code, right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server."
    * This will open the site in your browser at an address like `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **HTML5** for the core structure.
* **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN) for styling.
* **Vanilla JavaScript** for all interactivity and dynamic functionality.
* **Netlify** for hosting and form handling.
* **(Optional) Netlify Functions** for automating user submissions into the `resources.json` file.
